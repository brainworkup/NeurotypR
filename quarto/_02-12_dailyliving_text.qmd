Daily living skills testing revealed a complex pattern of strengths and weaknesses. While the patient demonstrated average abilities in basic functional tasks such as correctly paying a utility bill, reading a map to navigate through a city, and exercising adequate judgment and decision-making in emergency situations, there were significant concerns in other areas. Most notably, performance on a driving-related attention task was exceptionally low (1st percentile), suggesting potential safety concerns. Memory testing showed a pattern of intact immediate learning but poor retention, with immediate recall ranging from average to high average, but delayed recall and recognition often falling in the exceptionally low range (0.5th-21st percentile). This pattern suggests intact basic functional abilities but raises concerns about tasks requiring sustained attention or delayed memory retrieval.
