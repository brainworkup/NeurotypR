==============================================

## **Identifying Information**

## **Introduction**

As a forensic neuropsychologist, I have been retained to evaluate [Defendant's Name] in relation to their involvement in [briefly describe the alleged offense].

## **Clinical Evaluation**

Based on the evaluation, I conclude that [Defendant's Name] meets the criteria for mental health diversion, as outlined in [California Penal Code Section]. The defendant's mental health condition is a significant contributing factor to their alleged offense, and they would benefit from treatment and diversion rather than incarceration.
