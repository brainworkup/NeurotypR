Ms. Smalls shows a strong ability to learn and recall daily living skills but struggles to apply them functionally. While she performs well in recalling familiar routines, she has significant weaknesses in critical areas for independent living. She cannot manage basic financial tasks, such as bill payment, and has poor judgment in everyday situations (4th percentile), affecting decision-making in finances, safety, and vulnerability to exploitation. Her spatial navigation skills are limited, hindering independent mobility. Most critically, her delayed recognition of medication instructions is exceptionally low, posing a high risk for errors despite average initial learning. This disconnect between learning and practical application requires comprehensive supervision, especially in finances, medication management, and decision-making.
