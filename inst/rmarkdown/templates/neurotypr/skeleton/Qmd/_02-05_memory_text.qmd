Ms. Smalls shows strength in structured memory, performing in the High Average range for learning and retaining specific, repetitive verbal and visual information, such as routine procedures and familiar visual stimuli. However, she demonstrates significant weakness in narrative memory, scoring Below Average in recalling stories and contextually-rich information. This discrepancy suggests she can remember concrete details presented consistently but struggles with understanding and recalling conversations, verbal explanations, or complex financial concepts.

In practical terms, Ms. Smalls can likely handle basic, repetitive financial tasks but would face difficulty understanding and recalling financial discussions or explanations about investment options. Her vulnerability to false recognition further increases her risk of confusing legitimate and fraudulent financial requests. Given her intellectual disability, these memory limitations indicate she would need substantial support to manage complex financial matters related to her inheritance.
