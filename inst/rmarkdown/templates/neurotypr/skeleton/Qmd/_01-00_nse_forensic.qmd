= NEUROBEHAVIORAL STATUS EXAM
```

## Reason for Referral
Biggie Smalls, a 32-year-old female, was referred for a neurobehavioral status exam to evaluate her cognitive and functional abilities, with particular emphasis on assessing her capacity to manage finances and live independently.

## Background/History

### Developmental/Medical History
Ms. Smalls presents with a history of cognitive and functional impairments that have been previously documented through neuropsychological evaluation. Prior assessments revealed below-average intellectual functioning, with significant deficits in nonverbal reasoning and visuospatial skills. Her profile is characterized by marked impairments in executive functioning, including difficulties with planning, organization, self-monitoring, cognitive flexibility, working memory, and processing speed. Behavioral observations documented perseveration, micrographia (small, cramped handwriting), poor organizational skills, and inconsistent attention.

Ms. Smalls's cognitive profile shows a relative preservation of basic verbal skills while exhibiting significant difficulties with tasks requiring fluid reasoning, novel problem-solving, and executive functioning. She demonstrates deficits in delayed recall, spatial working memory, and selective attention, with unusual response patterns including random guessing and perseverative errors during cognitive testing.

### Behavioral/Emotional/Social
Ms. Smalls currently resides in a group home with three other residents, including one who is non-verbal and another with severe autism. She attends a daily program where she engages in various activities and has shown improvement in her ability to assist other clients and stand up for herself.

Ms. Smalls reports having a boyfriend, described as an ex-police officer training for the FBI; however, family members and evaluators question his existence as no one has met him. She becomes notably defensive when questioned about this relationship, suggesting social or emotional vulnerabilities. There are concerns about her susceptibility to manipulation in relationships, as well as observations that she may sometimes exhibit manipulative behaviors herself.

Her interests include gardening and previously caring for numerous pets including iguanas, turtles, and dogs, which appear to serve as meaningful activities and possible coping mechanisms. Ms. Smalls demonstrates significant difficulty with financial management, typically spending money quickly upon receipt without planning for future needs.

### Family History
Ms. Smalls's support system has been significantly impacted by the deaths of both parents. Her father, described as controlling particularly regarding finances, left approximately $70,000 upon his passing. Her mother, who previously assisted with financial management, also passed away after reportedly engaging in significant spending that led to housing instability. Ms. Smalls has an aunt who provides some support and assistance, though there appear to be strained relationships with family members who express skepticism about her reported boyfriend and concerns about her financial decisions.

### Educational History
Ms. Smalls demonstrates basic verbal skills and can perform simple tasks independently. However, she struggles with tasks requiring higher cognitive functions such as problem-solving and memory recall. Her functional educational attainment is evidenced by limited practical life skills; she has never independently managed bills or finances and is uncertain about her credit status. While she has obtained a driver's permit, she has never progressed to acquiring a full driver's license, suggesting difficulties with more complex aspects of driving or the licensing process.
