<summary>
Delayed recall of the story details over time was Above Average.
The percentage of story detail retained over time, scaled to how much was initially learned fell in the High Average range.
Learning and recognition of visual material (abstract shapes) was High Average.
Correct number of words learned on the fourth trial was High Average.
Recognition of the target visual material among nontarget distractors after a delay period was High Average.
Biggie's score on Figure Recall (long-term recall and reconstruction of a complex abstract figure) was High Average.
Performance on a more complex one-trial verbal learning and recall task (story learning) was High Average.
Biggie's score on Story Memory (expository story learning) was Average.
Recall of the list after a long (20-minute) delay was Average.
Yes/no recognition total hits was Average.
Biggie's score on Immediate Memory Index (composite verbal learning of a word list and a logical story) was Average.
Correct number of words learned on the third trial was Average.
Learning and recall of rote verbal information (word list) was Average.
Recall of the list after a short delay was Average.
Biggie's score on List Learning (word list learning) was Average.

Percentage of visual detail retained over time, scaled to how much was initially learned fell in the Average range.
Yes/no recognition total false positives was Low Average.
Spontaneous, long-term delayed recall (20-25 min) recall and reproduction of a complex abstract figure fell within the Low Average range.
Biggie's score on Delayed Memory Index (long-term recall of verbal information) was Low Average.
Biggie's Narrative Memory Free and Cued Recall score of  6 () is classified as Low Average and is ranked at the  9th percentile, indicating performance as good as or better than  9% of same age peers from the general population. This estimate of Narrative memory learning under free recall, cued recall, and recognition conditions is considered an area of typical functioning.
Biggie's score on List Recall (long-term recall of a word list) was Below Average.
Biggie's score on List Recognition (delayed recognition of a word list) was Exceptionally Low.
