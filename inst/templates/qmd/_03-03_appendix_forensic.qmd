## Test Selection Procedures

Neuropsychological tests are performance-based, and cognitive performance is summarized above. Cultural considerations were made in selecting measures, interpreting results, and making diagnostic impressions and recommendations. Test scores are reported in comparison to same-age and sex/gender peers, with labels (e.g., Below Average, Average, Above Average; [@guilmetteAmericanAcademyClinical2020]), intended to be descriptive, not diagnostic. Standardized scores provide important context, but do not alone lead to accurate diagnosis or treatment recommendations.
